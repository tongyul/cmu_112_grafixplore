## Where is `cmu_112_graphics.py`?

Since I didn't make or modify `cmu_112_graphics.py`, I'll just put this folder
here and you can download `cmu_112_graphics.py` yourself if eligible and put it
in this folder for all the files and demos to work.

I don't know what's the copyright status of `cmu_112_graphics.py` so I won't
risk it. I can tell you that this repo is based on version `0.9.2` of
`cmu_112_graphics.py`. The version of `cmu_112_graphics.py` (e.g. `0.9.2`) can
be checked at the start of the file in a snippet like so:

```python
import datetime
MAJOR_VERSION = 0
MINOR_VERSION = 9.2 # version 0.9.2
LAST_UPDATED = datetime.date(year=2022, month=3, day=29)
```

(Apparently (with irony) everyone should record their project versions as an
`int` and a `float`.)
